		<p class="sectionSubTagt text-small">Over the last decade, important change in conservation has been an increasing focus on human behaviour,motivated by the understanding that sustainable behavioural behavioural patter are the root cause behing current biodiversity and climate crisis. At the point when you are visting wild places don't evacuate wreck or expel ensured plant or creature species.Instead,find out increasingly about them and find how add to their security and rebuilding.Decline to purchase any articles produced using ivory.Because number of elephants are slaughtered for this purpose.Do not empower the brokers for getting them. At the point when you are out in the nation side,treat untamed life with respect.Do not upset animals,especially youthful animals.Watch them discreetly,from a separation without upsetting the harmony and serenity of their settling places.We realize the magnificence benefits and the estimation of nature.We must attempt to ensure it.The people in the future have comparable and equivalent right with us.So we should adore the nature and we need to give more consideration to take care of it.This is not sentiment or romantic imagination but a reality of a relationship with everything that lives and moves on the earth. Man has killed millions of whales and is still killing them. All that we derive from their slaughter can be had through other means. But apparently man loves to kill things, the fleeting deer, the marvellous gazelle and the great elephant. We love to kill each other. This killing of other human beings has never stopped throughout the history of man’s life on this earth. If we could, and we must, establish a deep long abiding relationship with nature, with the actual trees, the bushes, the flowers, the grass and the fast-moving clouds, then we would never slaughter another human being for any reason whatsoever. Organised murder is war, and though we demonstrate against a particular war, the nuclear or any other kind of war, we have never demonstrated against war itself. We have never said that to kill another human being is the greatest sin on earth.

 Always have a thought of nature before your actions.</p></b></h1></u>
		<p class="sectionSubTagt text-small">To stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature..Plants and trees are considered to be the rescuers of the nature. If we wouldn’t save them, our next generation will have to pay for it. So, just take care of them, they’ll take care of you. A study shows that having trees in your neighborhood will keep you away from many mental and physical diseases. They’ll have a very stimulating impact.One knows all this has been said before in different ways, but we don’t seem to pay much attention. Is it that we are so caught up in our own network of problems, our desires, our urges of pleasure and pain that we never look around, never watch the moon? Watch it. Watch with all your eyes and ears, your sense of smell. Watch. Look as though you are looking for the first time. If you can do that, you see for the first time that tree, bush or blade of grass. Then you can see your teacher, your mother or father, your brother or sister, for the first time. There is an extraordinary feeling about that: the wonder, the strangeness, the miracle of a fresh morning that has never been before and never will be.This is not sentiment or romantic imagination but a reality of a relationship with everything that lives and moves on the earth. Man has killed millions of whales and is still killing them. All that we derive from their slaughter can be had through other means. But apparently man loves to kill things, the fleeting deer, the marvellous gazelle and the great elephant. We love to kill each other.

		<p class="sectionSubTagt text-small">We should fully enjoy the nature without disturbing its ecological balance. We should care our nature, make it peaceful, keep it clean and prevent it from the destruction so that we can enjoy our nature forever. Nature is a most precious gift given by the God to us to enjoy but not to harm Nature is the world around us.Nature is the most valuable blessing given to us by God.It is our obligation to spare and take care of it.Unfortunately a few people don't understand this and begin to harm nature.  

Creatures and plants face the threat of population,explosion and ecological contamination . Common habitats,mainly timberlands are crushed by man for his modern life. Numerous plants and creatures are confronting extinction.Many types of reptiles,mammals,birds and restorative plants are lost.Protecting the remaining parts of nature is our significant obligation.  

Here I am going to tell about the means that we can take to spare the nature.Do not squander water when making a trip to places where it is scarce.When you are venturing out to does places you ought to maintain a strategic distance from the valuable fluid. 
Similarly, there is a difference between right relationship and understanding our relationship with nature. What is your relationship with nature? Nature is the rivers, the trees, the swift-flying birds, the fish, the minerals under the earth, the waterfalls and the shallow pools. What is your relationship with them? Most of us are not aware of that relationship. We never look at a tree, or if we do it is with a view of using that tree, either to sit in its shade or to cut it down for lumber. In other words, we look at trees with utilitarian purpose; we don’t look at a tree without projecting ourselves and utilising it for our convenience. We treat the earth and its products in the same way. There is no love of the earth; there is only usage of the earth. If one really loved the earth, there would be frugality in using the things of the earth.

		<p class="sectionSubTagt text-small">The term "nature" may refer to living plants and animals, geological processes, weather, and physics, such as matter and energy. The term is often refers to the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general areas that have not been substantially altered by humans, or which persist despite human intervention. For, example, manufactured objects and human interaction are generally not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature".

			or most of us, the mind is noisy, everlastingly chattering to itself, soliloquising or chattering about something, or trying to talk to itself, to convince itself of something; it is always moving, noisy. And from that noise, we act. Any action born of noise produces more noise, more confusion. But if you have observed and learned what it means to communicate, the difficulty of communication, the non-verbalisation of the mind—that it is that which communicates and receives communication—then, as life is a movement, you will, in your action, move on naturally, freely, easily, without any effort, to that state of communion. And in that state of communion—if you inquire more deeply—you will find that you are not only in communion with nature, with the world, with everything about you, but also in communion with yourself.
