 Control thoughts through mental peace.</h1></b></u>
		<p class="sectionSubTagt text-small">Drugs are very good at getting rid of pain, but they often have unpleasant, and even serious, side effects when used for a long time. If you have backache, fibromyalgia, arthritis, or other chronic pain that interferes with your daily life, you may be looking for a way to relieve discomfort that doesn't involve drugs. Some age-old techniques—including meditation and yoga—as well as newer variations may help reduce your need for pain medication.Research suggests that because pain involves both the mind and the body, mind-body therapies may have the capacity to alleviate pain by changing the way you perceive it. How you feel pain is influenced by your genetic makeup, emotions, personality, and lifestyle. It's also influenced by past experience. If you've been in pain for a while, your brain may have rewired itself to perceive pain signals even after the signals aren't being sent anymore.The Benson-Henry Institute for Mind-Body Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital specializes in helping people learn techniques to alleviate stress, anxiety, and pain. Dr. Ellen Slawsby, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who works with patients at the Benson-Henry Institute, suggests learning several techniques so that you can settle on the ones that work best for you. "I tend to think of these techniques as similar to flavors in an ice cream store. Depending on your mood,you might want a different flavor of ice cream—or a different technique," Dr. Slawsby says. "Practicing a combination of mind-body skills increases the effectiveness of pain relief.r

 To clean the surrounding areas.</b></h1></u>
		<p class="sectionSubTagt text-small">All of us live in a neighbourhood or surrounding. We must keep our surroundings neat and clean. This will help us to live healthy and better lives. Keeping our surroundings clean will only help in the betterment of society.Every household generates waste or garbage. Now, waste or garbage should not be thrown anywhere, and everywhere, but only in trash bins. Throwing garbage all over the place will only dirty our surroundings and pollute the environment. Controlling the use of plastic bags will also help to keep our surroundings clean. One should use recycled and eco-friendly products such as paper or jute bags instead of plastic bags. Throwing of plastic bags by the roadside only makes our surroundings dirty and unhygienic. Plastic bags are not soluble so they clog drains and cause water logging.Do not litter on the road or in your neighbourhood. Littering causes land, air and water pollution. Try planting trees and plants that will beautify our surroundings as well as keep us healthy. Greener surroundings look beautiful and also reduce pollution to keep us fit and healthy. Dirtying our surroundings will only cause harm to us. So, keep the surroundings clean and live happy and healthy lives.

 Therapy by nature's sound.</p></h1></b></u>
		<p class="sectionSubTagt text-small">You know that feeling of clear-headed calm that washes over you when you listen to water babbling down a stream, or leaves rustling in the wind? Researchers say they’ve pinpointed a scientific explanation for why sounds from nature have such a restorative effect on our psyche: According to a new study, they physically alter the connections in our brains, reducing our body’s natural fight-or-flight instinct.Natural sounds and green environments have been linked with relaxation and well-being for hundreds of years, of course. But the new research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, is the first to use brain scans, heart-rate monitors, and behavioral experiments to suggest a physiological cause for these effects.To investigate the connection between the brain, the body, and background noise, researchers at Brighton and Sussex Medical School in England recruited 17 healthy adults to receive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while listening to a series of five-minute soundscapes of natural and manmade environments.During each soundscape, participants also performed a task to measure their attention and reaction time. Their heart rates were monitored as well, to indicate changes in their autonomic nervous systems—the system.During each soundscape, participants also performed a task to measure their attention and reaction time. Their heart rates were monitored as well, to indicate changes in their autonomic nervous systems—the system of organs involved in involuntary processes such as breathing, blood pressure, temperature, metabolism, and digestion.When they studied the fMRI results, the researchers noticed that activity in the brain’s default mode network—an area involved in mind wandering and “task-free” states of wakefulness—varied depending on the background sounds being played. Specifically, listening to artificial sounds was associated with patterns of inward-focused attention, while nature sounds prompted more external-focused attention.Inward-focused attention can include worrying and rumination about things specific to one's self—patterns that have been linked to conditions involving psychological stress (including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder). Participants’ reaction times were slower when they listened to artificial sounds compared to natural ones, as well.

 Connecting to nature by gardening.</p></b></h1></u>
		<p class="sectionSubTagt text-small">Take a moment to close your eyes and consider the sights, sounds, and smells that you imagine when you think about being in nature. Perhaps you see a tiny trail meander through a dense forest or smell blossoming wildflowers as you summit a mountain peak. Maybe you feel the fresh ocean breeze blow through your hair as you dip your toes in the sand or hear the rush of a flowing waterfall as you paddle around the bend. By definition, a “nature lover” is someone who thrives on spending time in the outdoors and observing wild animals and plants. But there’s more to spending time in nature than just stepping outside. Nature teaches us how to adapt to new conditions, reminds us that the earth is always changing, and shows us the beauty in simplicity. It helps us disconnect from the stresses of daily life and focus on finding peace and purpose in a chaotic world. Mother Nature teaches us something new every day, and there are countless ways to soak in the spirit of the outdoors. So no matter where you live or how you define yourself, these are some of the best activities to get in touch with nature.Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to travel beyond your own backyard to experience the serene beauty of nature every day. If your personality is less adventurous or your mobility restricted, consider planting a garden to grow your own vegetables, fruits, herbs, or flowers. There’s something truly satisfying about mixing up a salad with fresh ingredients you grew yourself. One of the best parts about spending time in nature is that it doesn’t have to break your budget and anyone can do it. For more money-saving strategies and insider tips from travel experts,
